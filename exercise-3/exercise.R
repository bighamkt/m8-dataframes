# What was the 2015 salary of employee 57

# How many employees got a raise?
salaries[salaries$got.raise == TRUE,]
  #this statement reports every data point this is true for

# What was the value of the highest raise?
max(salaries$raise)
salaries[salaries$raise == max(salaries$raise),]

# What was the name of the employee who recieved the highest raise?


# What was the largest decrease in salaries between the two years?


# What was the name of the employee who recieved largest decrease in salary?


# What was the average salary increase?


### Bonus ###

# Write a .csv file of your salaries to your working directory


# For people who did not get a raise, how much money did they lose?


# Is that what you expected them to lose?

### Double Bonus (no answer given) ###

# Repeat the above experiment 100 times, tracking the loss each time.
# Does the average loss equal what you expect?
# What about 10,000 times?
